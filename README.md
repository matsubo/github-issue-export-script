# github issue export script

- Sample script to export pull requests and issues from github as CSV file.
- I'd recommend to use this repository by forking to your private space and edit the conditions in the files.

## Setup

```
% cp .env.sample .env
% vi .env
```

## Execute

Export github issues with specific culumns.
This script supports auto pagination.

```
% bash export.sh
```
